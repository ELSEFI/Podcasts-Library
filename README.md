# 🎧 Podcasts Library

**Podcasts Library** is a web-based platform designed to organize and present a diverse collection of podcasts, categorized by themes such as Art, Business, Science, Health, Self-development, and more. The goal of this project is to provide users with an engaging and accessible environment to explore and listen to valuable podcast content across different areas of interest.

## 🌐 Features

- 📚 **Categorized Content**: Podcasts are neatly organized under different categories like:
  - Art & Entertainment
  - Business
  - Education and Culture
  - Health & Wellness
  - News & Media
  - Science
  - Self-development
  - Personal Interests

- 🔐 **User Authentication**:
  - Sign Up and Sign In pages are included to simulate a user account system.

- 🎨 **Custom Styling**:
  - The design is styled using multiple CSS files (`mastylees.css`, `sgi.css`, `sgu.css`) to enhance the user interface and deliver a clean, modern look.
